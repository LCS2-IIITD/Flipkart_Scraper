If u r very heavy user it will easily last for 1 day . Normal and medium user it will last to 1.5 to 2 days\n5) speaker - speaker is nice because of placement of speaker with dolby atmos which will givd u crisp sound\n6) charging - charging time is also good it charges 5000mah battery in almost 3 hrs which is good in my opinon\n7) processor - although it do not has poweful processor but found no lag ( i m not a gamer but a moderate user )\n8) memory - 3gb ram and 32 gb rom is very good deal in this price\n9) ram management - it has very good ram management at this price point\n10) fingerprint - finger print sensor is also good in my opinion\n\nCONS:-\n\ncamera - the only con is camera is not that good as expected but u can take some desent (average) pics but do not expect too much with camera\n\nSome other thing like i have faith in moto brand because earlier i used moto g3 which i loved a lot and moto has good reputation in the market and also flipkart service is also very good in my opinon.

Hope it helps fellow buyers to choose the best as per their convinience.\n1) Battery (10/10). Main USP of this mobile. Will update more in couple of days.\n2) Android N 7.1.1 (9/10). Stock android with no problems at all.\n3) Fingerprint (9/10). Works like charm.\n4) Sound (9/10 speakers, 8/10 headset). With dolby atmos, speaker sound is fanatstic but lacks with headset. May be a better headset enhace the sound.\n5) Looks (9/10, Iron Grey). Looks superb just like a premium mobile.\n6) Lock screen notifications handling (8/10). New feature in Moto handsets, quite useful for people who get larger volume of notifications.\n7) Weight, Bulkness (7/10). A bit bulky and heavy in comparison to latest mobiles in market, but that may attribute due to high capacity battery it contains. Not a problem for people who doesn't mind a little bulky phones.\n8) RAM (8/10). Handles multitasking easily, noticed a few loading issues here n there but that is mainly due to the processor it contains.\n9) Call Quality (9/10). No problems as such as of now.\n10) Processor (6/10). The biggest drawback for this mobile is the Mediatek processor it has, though most of the mobiles in this segment comes with snapdragon but Moto chose to go with Mediatek. There is no comparison between both of these. Snapdragon is way way ahead of Mediatek. But again, to accomodate the prices under 10k segment and giving a feature rich mobile, motorola compromised with the processor. The mobile operations are a little bit on a heavier side, but works well.\n11) Screen Display (8/10). HD display (1280 x 720 Pixels) not full hd. Viewing angles are good, display scores above average.\n12) Camera (7/10). Nothing to boast of. Both rear and front camera are for namesake. Don't buy this if you are looking for fantastic clicks,it won't give u that.\n\nDisclaimer: I declare that the above review is totally unbiased and not intended to hurt anyboy's sentiments :)\nHit 'Like' if you like the review.

Battery: though the company claims about more than 24 hours battery back up but mine lasts not more than 16 to 18 hours.\n\nThough I had registered my complain on the 8 the day after receiving the the mobile set, before 10 days of the flipkart returns policy, I am yet to get many help from flipkart on its returns request. Just a message that somebody from technical team will call me to help about the phone. Now they have extended tthe day for contacting me, which is 12th day of the delivery date, so I don't think , flipkart will return the set or replace it.\n\nPros:\n\nGood display with blue light filter to use phone at night.\n\nLook wise good, but a bit heavy.\n\nCamera is good with flash for both camera.\n\nI will update after i get a remedy\nThanks"}, "73": {"title": "screen", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "date": [2017, 7, 19, 0, 0, 0, 2, 200, -1], "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/c1cca484-334c-48b3-abea-dc74802eda02", "downvotes": "13", "id": "c1cca484-334c-48b3-abea-dc74802eda02", "upvotes": "33", "exists": true, "author_name": "Flipkart Customer", "rating": 2, "text": "Low screen quality, low light camera ,call sansor does not work properly, battery backup good, price approx this phone 7999 only,4g network slow, voice reach not clearly another phone for 4g network ,tuch sensor mostly very good,thicknees more and weight heavy ,screen tuch working good ,screen size good ,"}, "74": {"date": [2017, 7, 14, 0, 0, 0, 4, 195, -1], "exists": true, "title": "Classy product", "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/6f9ff629-d578-4a88-a27d-88962b76bcbd", "downvotes": "8", "id": "6f9ff629-d578-4a88-a27d-88962b76bcbd", "upvotes": "23", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "author_name": "Mukesh Reddy", "rating": 5, "text": "Less price and good built quality"}, "75": {"title": "Nice product", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "date": [2017, 7, 15, 0, 0, 0, 5, 196, -1], "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/6d719032-a922-4f6d-b1b2-e2b2ef5c2164", "downvotes": "7", "id": "6d719032-a922-4f6d-b1b2-e2b2ef5c2164", "upvotes": "21", "exists": true, "author_name": "vivek patel", "rating": 4, "text": "Good phone but headset so poor"}, "76": {"date": [2017, 7, 15, 0, 0, 0, 5, 196, -1], "exists": true, "title": "Terrific purchase", "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/61956d12-846c-4eae-aa92-d6934ce02b7c", "downvotes": "6", "id": "61956d12-846c-4eae-aa92-d6934ce02b7c", "upvotes": "20", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "author_name": "TEJA AKHIL DADI", "rating": 5, "text": "Good product super quality camera good battery backup thank you moto"}, "77": {"title": "Four Stars", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "date": [2017, 7, 24, 0, 0, 0, 0, 205, -1], "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/09fc793c-e36d-4f7f-a204-6d61ed87e953", "downvotes": "0", "id": "09fc793c-e36d-4f7f-a204-6d61ed87e953", "upvotes": "5", "exists": true, "author_name": "Flipkart Customer", "rating": 4, "text": "Good Phone...\nPROS:-\n1.Good Camera\n2.Good Battery\n3.Good Sound\n4.Looks Good\n5.Fast & Smooth Fingerprint Scaner\n6.Good Other features..\nCONS:-\n1.Slightly heavy ( due to 5000mah battery )"}, "78": {"date": [2017, 7, 14, 0, 0, 0, 4, 195, -1], "exists": true, "title": "Perfect product!", "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/b6c9313d-ca54-4f8a-8e84-5ad15247e0d6", "downvotes": "0", "id": "b6c9313d-ca54-4f8a-8e84-5ad15247e0d6", "upvotes": "5", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "author_name": "Ashok P", "rating": 5, "text": "Good"}, "79": {"title": "Could be way better", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "date": [2017, 7, 15, 0, 0, 0, 5, 196, -1], "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/a0a0b4a6-bd12-48ff-97ef-36af77f84507", "downvotes": "82", "id": "a0a0b4a6-bd12-48ff-97ef-36af77f84507", "upvotes": "140", "exists": true, "author_name": "KRISHNAN IYER", "rating": 2, "text": "Touch is very bad takes erroneous input\n\nunable to setup my google account,after entering Email ID & password,\nNot accepting next key when i agree , unable to navigate to the next step\n\nVery disappointed after using Moto G2 for many years, I want to buy another Moto phone\n\nBut This Moto E4 Plus is not to my expectation.\n\nI have never experienced so much struggle to setup a phone Like this before\n\nMay be the piece is defective or all the Moto E4 Plus series it self is not up to the mark????"}, "80": {"date": [2018, 4, 17, 0, 0, 0, 1, 107, -1], "exists": true, "title": "Terrific", "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/b9c51560-6fc9-4453-8455-af2d056ec4d3", "downvotes": "1", "id": "b9c51560-6fc9-4453-8455-af2d056ec4d3", "upvotes": "9", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "author_name": "Ashwini Singh", "rating": 5, "text": "osam phone"}, "81": {"title": "Great product", "p_id": "MOBEU9WRZHNDJANR", "date": [2017, 7, 18, 0, 0, 0, 1, 199, -1], "verified_purchase": true, "review_url": "https://www.flipkart.com/reviews/5fb97ffe-e568-4cc4-bba6-a2d8a33c2130", "downvotes": "2", "id": "5fb97ffe-e568-4cc4-bba6-a2d8a33c2130", "upvotes": "8", "exists": true, "author_name": "Goldy Sehwag", "rating": 5, "text": "Best phone of dis range... better than redmi 4 and nokia 3.
